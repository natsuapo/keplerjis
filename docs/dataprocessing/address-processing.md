# Address related functions

Address related functions include those functions that modify address data, geocoding, and generate address data with coordinates (reverse geocoding) or other information (API).  

Not like other data processing which can be conducted offline, most of the address related functions need to call API to get extra data. 

In this system, the address related functions mainly use Google API and aims to process Google related data. (e.g. GMT data)
