# Spatial data processing functions

Spatial processing functions aim to modify the geometry information in the specific data source, or generate a new data source based on the geometry information of old data sources.

Spatial processing function items are available after users choose the column in `geometry` type or the latitude, longitude pairs.

## Developing memos
Spatial processing functions are mainly realized by turf package.
