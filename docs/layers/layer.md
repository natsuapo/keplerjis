# Layer enhancement

Though Kepler.gl provides several types of layers, which outperforms most of the GIS tools for representing spatial features and can meet the requirement of spatio-temporal visualization in most of the scenarios with the preprocessed data, the layer visualization is either inefficient or lack of features in some use cases, especially in the context of spatio-temporal analysis in Japan. 

In this system, several layers are created or enhanced for easier data handling and better visualization. 

<!-- - [Mesh code related layers](meshcode/meshcode-main)
- [trajectory layer](trajectory-layer)
- [Prefecture polygon layer](pref-layer)
- [Icon layer](icon-layer) -->

## Developing memos

To create layers, developers need to add layers in `src/layers`.

It is also necessary to modify the side-panel for layer settings in `src/components/side-panel/layer-panel/layer-configurator.js`
