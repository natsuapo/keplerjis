# Limitations and plans:

Most of the current limitations in this system are mentioned in the previous sections. 

Here I list a memo of the extra system enhancement function application and demand after the ICC work.

- [x] Currently, Kepler.gl icon layer is very limited in icon types. Especially, the train label is not available. I am investigating how to add more icons.
- [x] Reaggregation function for mesh code level.
- [x] Trip layer enhancement: will enhance trip layer for easier processing and visualization.
- [x] Processor function add: paste wkb or GeoJSON to directly generate a data source and layer.
- [x] Support directly loading TopoJSON file.
- [x] Japanese municipality based data visualization.

- [ ] Add more processing function to the extended Kepler.
- [ ] Create new layer from filterings.
- [ ] Enhancing legend part for map data output.
- [ ] Add a function to encoding shift-jis.

Any demand request is welcome.
