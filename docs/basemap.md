# Base Map

Original Kepler.gl provides several types of Mapbox base maps and user can add their own Mapbox base map in the base map side panel. However, these maps cannot be visualized without Mapbox Tokens and there are no tutorials for adding base maps besides Mapbox style. In this enhancement, the approach of adding external base maps is finally made out and all base maps in kepler.gl which require Mapbox Tokens have been replaced by open source base maps.

The method of switching base map is the same as the original Kepler.gl. The following screen shows the current implementation of include OpenStreetMap, Dark Matter, Positron and Geospatial Information Authority of Japan(GSI). In addition, for the ease of use in Japan, the default base map is the one provided by GSI, and the default map view is the Tokyo area.
